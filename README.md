In the present study, the research team explores whether an investor should invest in a fast food restaurant or sit-down brewpub. We examined historical stock data in order to predict which of the two options would be a better investment. Using historical data, we ran monte carlo simulations in order to strengthen our findings. Our team found that fast food restaurants have grown during COVID-19. On the other hand, sit-down restaurants remained flat. In conclusion, a fast-casual brewpub style restuarant would be a smart investment.
